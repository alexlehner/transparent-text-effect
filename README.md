Transparent Webkit Text Effect
=================================

This repository shows a simple technique for a transparent text effect for [Webkit compatible](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_web_browsers#WebKit-based) browsers. This can be useful for page/post titles or a nifty Hello, World! 

Remember to setup a safe fallback for non webkit browsers. Happy hacking!

## Colophon
As with any modern web projects, this demo would not be as simple without the work of others. Specifically this demo was inspired by [Andy Taylor](http://andytaylor.me/) and his [previous design](http://andytaylor.me/v3/). Here are some tools used in this repo.  

- [CSSUserAgent.js](http://cssuseragent.org/)
- [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/)
